Through the development of this program, I have gained a solid foundation in the principles of procedural programming using C++. I practiced implementing basic syntax and utilizing the iostream library to handle user interaction through the cout and cin commands. I learned how to build complex game logic using control flow structures, specifically the switch-case statement, which allowed me to create a branching narrative based on player decisions. Furthermore, I mastered the process of defining and invoking functions, as well as using function prototypes to organize my code effectively. A significant part of my learning involved understanding how to pass multiple parameters between functions to maintain the game's state and applying the concept of recursion to allow for level repeats and game restarts. Finally, I gained practical experience in managing local variables and data types to store and validate the choices that drive the story forward.
